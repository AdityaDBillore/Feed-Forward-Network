As there are many increasing cases of breast cancer, we are going to use artificial neural networks to predict two types of tumor viz. Malignant – a cancerous tumor which can nurture and spread to the other portions of the body whereas Benign – this tumor will develop but will not sweep to other portions of the body. We are using various models in this Breast Cancer Prediction and the models used are: Feedforward Neural Network (Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network). In this Breast Cancer dataset, we are given with many parameters to identify which tumor it is going to be and we get an encouraging accuracy of training set as 95.23% whereas the test set gives an accuracy of test set as 96.66% using Feedforward Neural Networks. 

The dataset that we will be using is the Breast Cancer prediction, which is acquired from the University of Wisconsin Hospital, Madison from Dr. William H. Wolberg. The dataset comprises of 699 rows and 11 attributes viz., id, Clump-thickness, Size-Uniformity, Shape Uniformity, Marginal Adhesion, Epithelial Size, Bare Nucleoli, Brand Chromatin, Normal Nucleoli, Mitosis, and Class. Attributes from 2 to 10 is used to show instances, however each instance indicates one of two possible classes i.e., benign tumor or malignant tumor. Benign and Malignant are the two types of tumors. Benign tumors stay at one spot and don’t spread to surrounding tissues, whereas malignant tumors are cancerous and spread rapidly and form new tumors. With respect to all these attributes we are going to find the Class (2- Benign and 4-Malignant). We are going to predict whether the tumor is either Benign or it is going to be Malignant. The 7th of our dataset contains missing values. The dataset is originally taken from Kaggle competition. You can find the link to the dataset below in the references.
