As there are many increasing cases of breast cancer, we are going to use artificial neural networks to predict two types of tumor viz. Malignant – a cancerous tumor which can nurture and spread to the other portions of the body whereas Benign – this tumor will develop but will not sweep to other portions of the body. We are using various models in this Breast Cancer Prediction and the models used are: Feedforward Neural Network (Multi-layer Perceptron Neural Network). In this Breast Cancer dataset, we are given with many parameters to identify which tumor it is going to be and we get an encouraging accuracy of training set as 99.96% whereas the test set gives an accuracy of test set as 96.66% using Feedforward Neural Networks.
